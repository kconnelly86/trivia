#This is a Spaceballs Trivia Game.

By pressing the start button you have 30 seconds to answer the 5 questions by selecting one of the options available to you. Once the done button is pressed or when the time runs out you will be shown a screen with the results of your quiz.

If you would like to reset the quiz so someone else may play just press the 'Reset' button and it will reload the start screen.

HTML, CSS, a sweet parallax star field, JS and Jquery were used to create this game.
